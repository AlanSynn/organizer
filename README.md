## üöÄ Quick Start

```bash
# Initialize with Google Gemini (cloud model)
organizer init --target ~/Organized --model gemini --api-key YOUR_API_KEY

# Add a source folder to monitor
organizer add-source ~/Downloads

# Organize files (creates a plan and asks for confirmation)
organizer organize

# Organize files in the current directory
organizer organize --now
```

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

Organizer stores configuration in `~/.organizer.rc` by default.

### Google Gemini Setup

```bash
# Basic setup
organizer init --target ~/Organized --model gemini --api-key YOUR_API_KEY

# Advanced setup with specific model
organizer init --target ~/Organized --model gemini --model-name gemini-pro --api-key YOUR_API_KEY
```

### Local Llama Setup

```bash
# Basic setup
organizer init --target ~/Organized --model llama --model-path /path/to/your/model.gguf

# Custom model parameters
organizer init --target ~/Organized --model llama --model-path /path/to/model.gguf \
  --model-params '{"n_ctx":4096,"n_threads":8}'
```

### Add Source Folders

```bash
# Add a source folder with default settings
organizer add-source ~/Downloads

# Add a source folder with specific file patterns
organizer add-source ~/Documents --pattern "*.pdf" "*.docx" --max-depth 2
```

---

## üß© Usage Examples

### Basic Organization

```bash
# Generate a plan and ask for confirmation
organizer organize

# Create a plan without executing it
organizer organize --plan-only

# Skip confirmation
organizer organize --yes

# Test run (no changes)
organizer organize --dry-run
```

### Advanced Options

```bash
# Only organize outdated folders (not organized in 7 days)
organizer organize --outdated-only

# Change the outdated threshold
organizer organize --outdated-only --days 14

# Organize files within the current directory
organizer organize --now

# Include files that have already been organized
organizer organize --include-organized

# Combine options
organizer organize --now --yes --incremental
```

### Status and Reporting

```bash
# Check which folders are outdated
organizer check-outdated

# Show current configuration and status
organizer show-config

# Display information about the tool and its author
organizer about
```

### Logging Control

```bash
# Control logging verbosity
organizer organize --log-level debug    # Highly detailed logging
organizer organize --log-level info     # More detailed than default
organizer organize --log-level warning  # Default: warnings and errors
organizer organize --log-level error    # Only error messages
```

## üîë Key Features

### üìä Intelligent Categorization

Organizer uses AI to analyze filenames and file contents to determine the most appropriate categorization:
- Creates up to 3 levels of folder hierarchy
- Suggests descriptive filenames while preserving original extensions
- Handles files based on both name and content analysis

### üîÑ Smart Duplicate Handling

- Detects true duplicates by comparing filename and file size
- Moves duplicates to a "duplicated items" folder in the source directory
- Preserves original files for review
- Prevents redundant processing of duplicate files

### üì± In-Place Organization

The `--now` option organizes files within the current directory:
- Uses current directory as both source and target
- Creates appropriate folder hierarchies in-place
- Perfect for quick organization without configuration
- Can be combined with other options like `--incremental` and `--yes`

### ‚è±Ô∏è Skip Already Organized Files

By default, Organizer skips previously organized files:
- Detects files already processed based on existing structure
- Saves time and reduces API calls by focusing on new files
- Can be disabled with `--include-organized` flag
- Works with all organization commands including `--now` and `--outdated-only`

### üìà Outdated Folder Tracking

- Tracks when each folder was last organized
- Identifies folders not organized within a set period (default: 7 days)
- Allows selective organization of only outdated folders
- Provides visual reports showing outdated folders with timestamps

---

## üêö Shell Integration

Integrate Organizer with your shell environment (bash, zsh) for convenient access from anywhere.

### Automatic Installation

```bash
# In the project directory
./scripts/install_shell.sh
```

This script:
- Detects your current shell (bash or zsh)
- Checks for Poetry installation and configures accordingly
- Adds necessary functions to your shell configuration
- Sets up useful aliases
- Enables command auto-completion

### Manual Installation

Add to your `.bashrc` or `.zshrc`:

```bash
# Organizer function
organize() {
  if command -v organizer &> /dev/null; then
    organizer "$@"
  elif [ -d "venv" ] || [ -d ".venv" ]; then
    # Run in virtual environment
    if [ -d "venv" ]; then
      source venv/bin/activate
    else
      source .venv/bin/activate
    fi
    organizer "$@"
    deactivate
  fi
}

# Convenient aliases
alias org="organize"
alias orgnow="organize --now"
alias orgplan="organize --dry-run"

# Enable auto-completion (Bash)
_ORGANIZER_COMPLETE=bash_source organize --install-completion > /dev/null 2>&1

# For Zsh, use this instead:
# _ORGANIZER_COMPLETE=zsh_source organize --install-completion > /dev/null 2>&1
```

### Usage After Shell Integration

```bash
organize           # Standard file organization
org                # Alias for organize
orgnow             # Organize current directory
orgplan            # Show organization plan only
orgauto            # Run without confirmation
```

### Auto-Completion

After installation, Organizer commands support tab completion:

```bash
organize <TAB>     # Show available commands
organize init -<TAB>   # Show available options for init command
```

---

## üìÑ Document Content Analysis

For document files, Organizer extracts content for more accurate categorization based on actual document contents rather than just filenames.

### Supported Document Types

- **PDF files (.pdf)** - Extracts text from the first few pages
- **Word documents (.docx, .doc)** - Extracts text from the document

This allows for much better organization of documents by topic and content, especially when filenames are not descriptive.
